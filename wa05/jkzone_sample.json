    "Review_Content": "﻿D∆WN - Infrared \n\n\nPost-Blackheart I have high expectations for any Dawn Richard release but they aren’t met here; especially surprising given this is produced by Kingdom whose production is too bloated for her style. Gone is Dawn’s clever lyricism from Blackheart which was at times abstract, metaphorical and personal. Infrared is thematically promising but never really goes anywhere.",

    "Review_Content": "﻿I have major respect for chaz's diverse and prolific output, he's always pushing himself in a new direction. The few things I've actively listened to in the past haven't held me but I like this album: hip, poppy electro with a loner vibe.",

    "Review_Content": "ï»¿A varied album of what I think of as adult contemporary. The use of a drum machine on some tracks I thought hampered the preciousness and authenticity that hangs around the rest of the album. Consistent with the rest of their catalog there are standout pop tracks with beautiful lyrics to be found but I prefer other albums of theirs.",
