Gone is Dawn’s clever lyricism from Blackheart which was at times abstract, metaphorical and personal. Infrared is thematically promising but never really goes anywhere.",

    "Review_Content": "ï»¿Great record. \n\n\nI've been a big fan of Nicolas jaar since his BBC Essential mix (I'll express my appreciation for the essential mix in a separate post but I found it life changing (seriously)). At the time his other mixes were distinctly different and catered more to the dance floor. The tracks on these mixes seemed to be little more than a tasteful vocal sample, after laughter comes tears for example, with bass and rhythm mixed in. Another element I've appreciated of his is the slightly off-tempo drum lines which add a human element to the music. \n\n\nSince then his proper releases have shown similarities but the songs are more polished and structured. On 2012-2017 it seems he's returning to the basic sample approach and aiming clearly at the dance floor, the result is seriously good and the release I wasn't sure he'd make. \n\n\nI view this album as 'uncut' where most tracks could easily be edited down, truthfully I think he could've worked this into a perfect 25-30 minute mix. But what's here is so good that I think it's a must hear for any dance fan and an accessible release I expect will be picked up by a lot of DJs.",

    "Review_Content": "﻿Overall it's a nice set of pop songs that are varied in their songwriting. Rubblebucket is a big group with layers of instrumentation including brass and keys. Kalmia Traver’s voice is pleasant, reminds me of Lætitia Sadier from Stereolab (though missing the lyrical genius there). Happiness is abuzz on Omega LaLa with an almost skalike energy. I think the version on Spotify has some distracting sound effects mixed in as it seems different than the version I used to listen to, small slight though. \n\n\nI listened to this record a lot when it first came out and it doesn't feel as strong upon revisiting. On a personal level it reminds me of a person I don't speak with, maybe's what makes this a strange album to hear again.",

I generally like the bluesier tracks better (episode one, Danube Delta blues, song for Jimi) but the slower ballad-like pieces are good too, almost like a lively Jim Hall. \n\n\nI found this album while looking for albums that feature the fantastic drummer Rudy Royston. I'm glad I did as American Trailer has introduced me to Rudy Linka whose guitar playing I really enjoy here: sweet tone that's precise but laid-back at the same time. \n\n\nAmerican Trailer is an accessible album with pop-like melodies and familiar blues licks that I recommend.",

It's relatively bare bones otherwise which is surprising considering four tets knack for layering. \n\n\nAn enjoyable listen for fans of post rock or an excellent starting place for those unfamiliar with the genre.",

This album starts off as solid barebones rock and roll. It recounts the doors (black juju), and a forebearer to chord driven punk like the Ramones (Long way to go), sounds of Iggy pop and Black Sabbath are definitely at play. \n\n\nUnfortunately it feels slightly watered down from those greats and it begins to show itself as the album wears on; I just don't find it to be a great listen. Hard to write as I know this was influential to many but to my ears it just doesn't stand the test of time. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Info \n\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/Alice-Cooper-Love-It-To-Death/release/5094226 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen! \n\n\nYoutube \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRFnnVMawpY \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgTVKW7g2Dg \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHrfRul7gQ \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTMH9V9OLdg \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2HKxS_HMT8 \nSpotify",

No bass or percussion, Nico's distinct voice is at the center of it all, singing lyrics about friends, life, change, stories of new york (especially convincing considering she didn't write any of the lyrics). \n\n\nI like the dark textures of ‘it was a pleasure then’, an electric guitar is employed to do general noodling and effects before breaking into some dissonant soundscape. It's particularly effective given the album had been entirely acoustic. \n\n\nThoughts \n\n\nThis album has aged very well. Nico's nonchalant character feels very New York and the album carries a feeling of walking around the city. Her vocal range is limited but her distinct masculinity is appealing. \n\n\nI see this continuing to have a 'cool' appeal for future listeners through her association with the velvet underground.

I know I wasn't alone cause it was played constantly on the radio. It's an important part of the development of my musical taste. \n\n\nHowever even without that attachment the record has some all-out classics and otherwise great songs. Her lyrics are as the title would suggest, jagged. She's observant and articulate which is why I think this has such universal love. The lyrics are highly memorable. Her songs often employ a juxtaposed approach: aggressive and then a quiet 'innocent' moment. It creates a dynamic aspect to her tracks \n\n\nInstrumentation- love the textures, where was that bassline in the original master of you oughta know? There's an interesting drum-loop like thing happening there. It appears again on you learn, giving a slight hip hop like bounce. Overall a perfect balance of alt and grunge textures in the singer-songwriter space. Her vocal range is impressive and perhaps best on display on forgiven. Perfect is over the top in it's forced emotion around bad parenting. \n\n\nAn enjoyable trip down memory lane that stands the test of time. \nMore Info \n\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/Alanis-Morissette-Jagged-Little-Pill/release/1358782 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen! \n\n\nYoutube \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPcyTyilmYY \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v9yUVgrmPY \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpotify",

It's got that emo teen vibe uzi has - I really like the sound. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThoughts \nThis is great. I don't see the album having any lasting replayability but in 2018 it works. Feels like it's a continued progression of the 'not really saying anything' lyricism but proves that content isn't needed if it's catchy. With that in mind this is a true reflection of the times and communication: the message doesn't matter as long as it looks or sounds a certain way. He's also got some impressive guest spots who adapt to his style and flow. I find this telling about his relevance as he's pulling big names into his orbit. \n\n\nI think the mistake someone could make is approaching this as a traditional rap album. His style is so drastically different than say illmatic that we need to see it as a purely aesthetic piece and consider it differently. In that way it succeeds massively. Creating something original that's just throwing constant rhythmic hooks at you. It's almost as if you're listening to a warm-up session where they're just feeling out the beat trying to flow, not working on the perfect verse. I see a lot of followers from this. He's actually at his worse in the middle of the album when he's speaking clearly. \n\n\nMore Info \n\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/Playboi-Carti-Die-Lit/release/12102645 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen! \nSpotify",

Cherry's trumpet playing is in top form with expansive but delicate solos (interesting in this context as I associate him with avant garde dissonance). Descending moonshine dervishes is the highlight as the two seem most in sync with Riley's organ solos building into tasteful melodic lines that cherry tastefully solos over. \n\n\nI heard this on the YouTube version which I think is incorrect. Sunrise of the planetary collective sees Riley playing solo on a more electric keyboard that provides an ominous tone. Koln improv falls somewhere in the middle with cherry returning but the keys continuing in their electric sound. Less spiritual, more jazz. \n\n\nMore Info \n\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/Terry-Riley-Don-Cherry-Karl-Berger-K%C3%B6ln-February-23-1975/release/8692739 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen! \n\n\nYoutube \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6449e2LsUI \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpotify",

Allmusic has more: \n\n\nDoom was at his rawest and, lyrically, most dexterous. The out-of-left-field edge of Doom's production -- which features '80s soul and smooth jazz mixed with classic drum breaks -- is indeed abstract at times, but his off-kilter rhymes are palatable and absent any pretentiousness. In fact, the album arguably contains some of the freshest rhymes one might have heard around the time of its release. \n\n\n\n\nThoughts \nDoom's style certainly isn't for everyone but the more I see rap evolve the more I realize just how remarkable his distinct style is. \n\n\nNot much to add to the allmusic review. This album is raw - both lyrically and production wise. His raps are dense, he's clearly an intelligent guy, switching topics quickly; a tactic which rewards repeat listens. Something about his delivery reminds me of Wutang, a rare quality.

After reading the wikipedia its clear Alex Turner is clearly inspired by all the right people. Production is gorgeous with that modern style where everything is turned up in the mix and makes for a rich listen. \n\n\nI think the lyrics are the weak point: self indulgent, forced poetry that's trying too hard to be weird. Its not bad but at best like a cult record I'll enjoy as passive listening; unnecessary at worst. \n\n\nI want to love this record, and believe I haven't given it the full chance, but after two listens it still hadn't set in. \n\n\n\n\nMore Info \n\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/Arctic-Monkeys-Tranquility-Base-Hotel-Casino/release/11952906 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen! \n\n\nYoutube \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXuUAtAtMtM \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71Es-8FfATo \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uGQ_ypTw08 \n\n\n\n\nSpotify",

Good use of distortion but otherwise the playing isn't quite soulful enough. \n* Album has a good flow. Almost has a classical like sway to it. Notes are long and melodic.

Considering this my favorite tracks are Replenish are and Fyfo, an accessible pair indebted to hip hop. \n\n\nIt's an interesting listen and something that deserves decent headphones or speakers that can separate the mix as it can be a lot to pick out at times.

This record combines something of the free and revitalist approach but does so in a modern way that feels fresh. \n\n\nCredit is due to the band and leadership of Ambrose. He's a trumpet player who's style I actually enjoy and is executing a vision perfectly. Justin Brown's drumming is always impressive and his influence can't be understated. I find he works very well as a member as a band rather than a leader; see my notes on nyeusi for more there. \n\n\nConflicted on what to rate this so gave it a 3 for now. Believe I need a bit more time to really set in with listening sessions where I can enjoy this. Overall a great record with fresh ideas, recommended. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Info \n\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/Ambrose-Akinmusire-A-Rift-In-Decorum-Live-At-The-Village-Vanguard/release/10749297 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen! \nSpotify",

Exploratory playful, energetic, progressive: what jazz is all about. \n\n\nRecommended tracks: ox tales, repetitive drumline pushes things forward with a soulful keys solo on top, King drive utilizes a James Blake pitched down vocal to extreme effectiveness on a track already utilizing off-time signatures. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Info \n\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/Makaya-McCraven-Where-We-Come-From-CHICAGOxLONDON-Mixtape/release/12364402 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen! \nSpotify",

Add in some punchy bass and solos that carry with energy and character, has a 70s grit to it. \n\n\nThe writing is great too, taking pop and turning them into jazz songs (really well done, not just half-baked covers) Sudan is a great piece where I feel the band gels more and feels slightly less arranged. (Admittedly the track I said to myself ok this is a really good album). I don't want you know more is a greater closer. Bit new Orleans brass with a floating keys line and funky get up and dance drum beat, ends with the right energy. \n\n\nAllmusic got it right: \n\n\nBut the complete disregard for the political correctness of \"Jazz\" itself, in order to get the deeply funky and soulful grooves across, is what makes this set so damn special and even spiritual in its inspiration. Jazz purists lost all credibility when they slagged this one off, caught as they were in tainted, even racist views of the past that made no allowances for jazz musicians to actually follow their time-honored tradition of mining the pop music of the day to extend the breadth and reach of jazz itself. Anybody who wants to believe that George Gershwin is somehow more important than George Porter Jr. is already lost in his own cultural fascism. Muhammad, who understands this better than anyone, pulled out all the stops here and blasted out one amazingly tough, funky slab.

I really want to like this, and do enjoy the texture and overall vision she's crafting. I think a lot of that is due to Sebastian's production which has matured quite a bit since the days of Ed Banger. It's as if someone watered down Air’s ‘cherry blossom girl’ and added pop focused songwriting. \n\n\nThere's a few great tracks. ‘Sylvia says’ features big production and personal memorable lyrics.

It's this juxtaposition of such a mature voice being coupled with an edgy sound that gives it the appeal.

Tracks rely on heavily repeated vocals and rhythmic bits to great effect, felt very inspired by the classic breakbeat aesthetic of the second track. ‘Reassuring’ utilizes a downpitched vocal sample, creating a bumping homage to early James Blake. His percussive sense comes out on the 2nd half in the form of an appealing rhythmic bounce. \n\n\nThis is good to great, accessible and catchy.

I find pleasure discovering sounds and appreciate art that maintains this same dynamism. It's reflected in a broader cultural awareness with my generation, whose been raised with the internet and the power of having humanity's entire cultural output instantly available. So what do you do with it? You take your favorite parts and begin creating something new, sampling in other words. \n\n\nI find this to be a representative album for today's sample based culture as Banks, a versatile MC, floats effortlessly between pop and rap on this impressive set of alt-electro productions (think sampling today rather than the past). I appreciate rappers who are able to carve distinct sounds for themselves and feel this is a classic in the marriage of rap and electro. \n\n\nListening notes on specific time: \n* 212 - immediately and undeniably great \n* Idlest delilah / soda is glitchy greatness and a personal favorite \n* ‘Gimme a chance’ succeeds as an OK pop song before switching into a gripping latin bit (maybe corny but I genuinely like it). \n* BBD, ice princess, Yung Rapunxel take a turn into harder boomy beats that sound a little dated after the edm boom. \n* Things drift off towards the end, but she soars on miss camaraderie.

At 32 and feeds a trip down nostalgia lane while still feeling new. \n\n\nStandards \n\n\nDon't like this one as much as intersections. Pretty good for the genere, mature emo singer songwriter.

Purists might disagree but I think this is an exemplar of rock and jazz fusion due to it's heavy rock lean and accessibility. The mixing is weird: no single tracks but rather two lengthy sides where thing's fade into the other, often forcing unfinished ideas to come together abruptly; almost like an impatient DJ. Anyhow the music: \n\n\nSide 1 is the better example of the miles 'rock’ thing with a driving bass line and angular guitars propelling things forward. It’s an extended classic 70s rock jam with a groove. \n\n\nSide 2 is where thing's get a bit more chilled out and experimental. The music wanders and isn't as focused. Still.. things are being worked out and it's fantastic music by any means. A highlight is the moment ‘in a silent way’ breaks through. Glorious! \n\n\nI consider miles electric period one of the pinnacles of music and this is one of the best intros, especially for non-jazz fans. \n\n\nEssential music. \n\n\n\n\nMore Info \n\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/Miles-Davis-A-Tribute-To-Jack-Johnson/release/1941575 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen! \n\n\nYoutube \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8TdZFVj6tA \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoH6kFbuYRQ \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfLvNwxnj6g \n\n\n\n\nSpotify",

At times they mimic Stereolab and CAN with the organ and spritely bounce so often employed in their songs. I'd say these guys are a bit more laid back and not quite as tight. There's an exploratory rhythm and that's perhaps what invokes CAN, each beat feels like they're chugging into new territory and comfortable with wherever they end up (perhaps this natural optimism is what makes stereolab so infectious). \n\n\nPantechnicon is a good one, the keys feel a bit more fun and it signals a more melodic shift overall. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Info \n\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/Cavern-Of-Anti-Matter-Void-BeatsInvocation-Trex/release/8143859 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen! \n\n\nYoutube \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIPfPQslS-s \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njkK_YO6Zt0 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVNhXIaXtFI \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2dZ46U2pl8 \n\n\nSpotify",

Here we have a sketchbook like view of Prince's songwriting process (Purple rain, for instance, is just a brief thought in this session. It would be fleshed out months later). Intimacy is immediately established given the stripped down nature of this recording: gone are the sequenced to perfection drum machines and synths that would obscure him at times. It's as if you're hearing him with his guard is down and the beauty of his songwriting takes center stage. \n\n\nWhile Prince's multi instrumentation ability is common knowledge here we learn he's a fantastic piano player, effortlessly toying with melody. \n\n\nI see, feel and understand his soulful approach to music better after listening to this.

Things pickup with 'rotation' and ‘pine ave’, blurring the lines between ambient and IDM. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Info \n\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/Nao-Tokui-Mind-The-Gap/release/176683 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen! \n\n\nYoutube \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvh3u6zPmtw \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DZrv_A4CPs \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESrzFDBIZcA \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3M7ckJyWj0 \n\n\nSpotify",

All of this additional instrumentation is good with songwriting that builds in a skillful way. I think it's a stretch to call this emo jazz as it's referenced on Wikipedia but it's distinct enough to call out. \n\n\n‘Honestly’ is a great highlight showing the strengths of this album: mellow catchy introspection breaking into an extended jam type thing; letting emotion and tension playout in a natural way. You can feel the frustration and confusion of a breakup. \n\n\nThis type of genuineness is what drew me to emo initially and is captured beautifully here.

Noah Shebib's dark, ambient production has been a major factor in Drake's success and fits his 'sad’ vibe perfectly. \n\n\nOn More Life we're treated to a great selection of tracks that show how he's pushed the incorporation of global dancehall into pop music.

I think I was too young when I first heard it, I wasn't drawn to it's sound. Even now I wouldn't recommend this to anyone under 30, the essence is lost without that unnerving only adulthood can provide. \n\n\nAt surface level it's boring adult pop, listen a little closer and you'll hear solid American folk songs. Backed by light (mostly) and tight instrumentation, it's just the right amount of precise while not feeling overly polished; a quality which typically bothers me but here it fits. Tweedy's got a pleasant voice and is an exceptional lyricist, switching between abstract thoughts and relatable lyrics on love. Few writers can capture anxiety, in its many forms, so poetically. It's his ability that elevates this album, turning these dense subjects into carthic singalongs. Ultimately the listener is left with a feeling of hope through the reliability in his words. True art captures some element of the human condition and I think Wilco nailed it on Yankee hotel foxtrot \n\n\nAnyone who's ever experienced that spinning out of control feeling will understand the value of something grounded. The perfect soundtrack for something as enjoyable as a pleasant autumn day or as heavy as your car ride after checking out of the insane asylum. \n\n\nMore Info \nhttps://www.discogs.com/Wilco-Yankee-Hotel-Foxtrot/release/1073285 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen! \n\n\nYoutube \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gupjrl5ZSX0 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBhj73WtiZU \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlxH9-TYseY \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efq95Pfqt5U \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKj5xIp4Kkg \nSpotify",

This is one of the better albums if that era, sounds a little dated but the smooth soul still works. \n\n\nThere's an excellent interplay between the musicians. Even with Byrd himself, he'll drop in for a trumpet solo but it never feels fully focused on him; more just part of an overall vibe.

Revisiting the album in its entirety I can appreciate this much more as a cohesive document. Texturally I think they're strongest when things are slowed down - easy bassline and slide guitar, like a modern noir take on the blues. Sivert Hoyem's commanding voice is effective and works well with the straightforward but poetic lyrics. It can be bleak, like a lonely dusty highway at night: surrounded by darkness but just as aware light would only illuminate a vast emptiness. \n\n\nMore Info \nhttps://www.discogs.com/Madrugada-The-Nightly-Disease/release/512675 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen! \nYoutube \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ne6c3LuD40 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNppGG71A-c \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhSSKc-EGic \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcZ5cKyceKM \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN0pENoxVBg \nSpotify",

It's effective here but on other releases I haven't had the patience to make it through a whole album. Apparently on the Anteroom he's returned to his earlier roots so maybe I need to go back further in his catalog. \n\n\nThe production is fantastic and totally my style with a range of influences that can be hard and dissonant. His songwriting builds towards enjoyable climaxes that fold into other builds. The whole thing flows together, telling some bizarre confessional love story. It feels like he's low in the overall mix providing an obscured feeling where his voice isn't the focal point as in most r&b. \n\n\nTracks are highly accessible with some great singles in body fat and non killing. I love the dark suicidal stream of consciousness on July 13th, which is laid out over postal service dntel like production. Follows in direct contrast to the standout nonkilling just before it. \n\n\nMore Info \n\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/How-To-Dress-Well-The-Anteroom/release/12732184 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen! \nSpotify",

There are shapes of songs here and lots of melodic lines to grip on to which keeps it somewhat engaging. I like the basic drum machine, it's like an incompetent robot drummer. Adds this synthesized layer to ‘Katherine’ that adds so basic it stands as a nice supplement to the pleasant, wistful reverb driven guitar playing. \n\n\nThis came out in 1979 and I can see it being hugely influential then as the electric guitar was still finding itself. Listening to it almost 40 years later it holds up well. I think there's a whole scene of bedroom musicians and chillwave artists striving to create the same thing. \n\n\nMore Info \n\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/The-Durutti-Column-The-Return-Of-The-Durutti-Column/release/807151 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen! \nSpotify",

The first half is an excellent set of mature chilled-out indie rock. Cox is an excellent lyricist, a natural poet without pretense. His vocal range is limited but he works it well here, changing styles as needed but with a certain drifting casualness. Has a slight twinge of panda bear like psychedelica. \n\n\nThings drag toward the end, track times get longer and I find it a bit exhausting. \n\n\nTe amo is a magnificent track. \n\n\nThis album is as good as any great indie album I've heard in the past 10 years.

It doesn't sound as good or profound as it did 20 years ago but I think I'm the one that's changed. Addressing its faults I'd point to overly wordy lyrics and bland instrumentation. However the melodies and just straightforward memorability of these songs is hard to deny.

Here she feels at her most personal, leaning heavily into R&B with a southern flair from the strong muscle shoals backing band. The result is wonderful and presents her in a very accessible format for rock fans. While she still sings with gospel flair at times (pullin ends with a particularly feverous higher calling) it's done so in a way that integrates smoothly with the r&b sound. \n\n\nThere's a few weaker tracks towards the end but the overall sound of this record, pairing the queen of soul with an almost raw blues band, makes this one not to miss. \n\n\nFor further reading around her personal history and troubles going into this are documented well in the Pitchfork review (https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/aretha-franklin-spirit-in-the-dark/). \n\n\n\n\nMore Info \nhttps://www.discogs.com/Aretha-Franklin-Spirit-In-The-Dark/release/3020902 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen! \nSpotify",

This album features contemporary compositions rooted in post bop, incorporating elements of hip hop and rock seamlessly. Other reviews applaud the drumming but I think the varied but always strong songwriting is the real standout: ‘twin’ a rhythmic post bop thing, ‘perspectives’ a quiet piece made engaging by a shimmering layer of keys is the perfect lead into the rocking ‘west of the west’ where rocking electric guitar cuts right through the calm. The later half of the album mellows into more traditional post bop carried by strong playing. \n\n\nI wasn't left with much memory of his trumpet playing but I think that's a good thing as he thrives in versatility. Utilizing tasteful effects when appropriate or a bit of technical flexing in others. His solos are never imposing like certain bandleaders. \n\n\nIt's great and I'm looking forward to checking more out from him.

Clocking in at roughly 15 minutes it encompasses just under half the album. It has this stop and go kind of momentum with the refrain opening into each of the solos. Reminds me of in a silent way where the song unfolds in these wave type parts, layering on top of each other. \n\n\nThe rest of the outing is pretty good hard bop but never captures that same high.

I feel these would work best in mixes, appearing as moments in some type of raw performance setting. All tracks utilize this slight distortion as if the drum pad got a small spill of beer on it and the effects are just slightly warped; things are coming through but something is slightly off. It's rough not so much in tone like industrial productions but in polish as if he's making this live; letting the drum machine go on for too long alone on lemming for instance. It's ultimately effective at building the tension through an uncertainty as it he figuring out how these tracks are going to work. \n\n\nReally dig the first track with a moody mournful vocal that stood out with that distorted bass thump. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Info \n\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/Florian-Kupfer-I-Feel-You/release/7327553 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen! \n\n\nYoutube \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0LVImlFDyg \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNNVR4Q3I2I \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrfMHgPWymI \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JdqOXhHd3I \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1OdwGdo4Jk \nSpotify",

This is a definitive vaporwave album and representative example of the genres aim. With just the right amount of maddening cheese, it doesn't feel like it's deliberate satire (well maybe on wifi sushi which is almost laugh out loud funny). He really captures the excitement that once existed about globalization's limitless possibility unlocked by the consumer. In hindsight we can see growth in corporate culture has just led to disappointment and further inequality, revealing an entirely new interpretation of this music. \n\n\nAs art I applaud it, its effective and immediate.

The lead-off track is a jazzy pop thing I enjoy, not sure what language she's singing but it fits with the basic sax to set the exotic tone. 'Quiver' works with a detached feeling like Drake's music or certain portishead. The spacey 'kulala' is another standout, a swelling keys line and ping pong balls swirl around a peaceful vocal line. \n\n\nThis sits right on the border of the worldly music craze that's taken over pop production but iZem is on the interesting side, exploring the sound with organic instrumentation. It's as if this is an afro focused record that's been influenced by Drake, not vice versa. Vocalists aren't very distinct but I enjoy them, at least the language is varied. He's at his best with vocalists, not always an easy thing to do as a producer. \n\n\nMeditative, transporting, fresh and enjoyable; recommended. \n\n\nMore Info \n\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/iZem-Hafa-/release/9230946 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen! \n\n\nYoutube \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZrmeKnof44 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5v41wqHZYc \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpotify",

It's fusion in the sense that they draw from so many influences (rock, funk, jam bands, classical) while still staying true to jazz. My only fault is also the biggest compliment: their compositions are fantastic but can have the rehearsed stuffiness at times; missing the loose rawness of jazz I'm typically drawn to. They are so tight but I prefer their live studio albums as it adds that looseness. \n\n\nAs for individual tracks: \n\n\n'Celebrity' is a great track, love the albums Dre g-funk from the keys line to the wompy bass effects. \n\n\nHas a nice flow, 'strawman's' mellow beginning is a good example of this, drawing from jambands with quick guitar work and Herbie funky keys. \n\n\n'34 klezma' begins with a yiddish rhythm and rich strings and piano, it's decadent in a classical sense. \n\n\nCan't go wrong with a snarky puppy release \n\n\nMore Info \n\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/Snarky-Puppy-Bring-Us-The-Bright/release/6447917 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen! \n\n\nYoutube \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGMYxIGIzmM \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pZdwTTZuOc \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpotify",

After many repeated listens the album is top heavy with good singles like 'maybe you're the reason' and 'you seemed so happy', the later borrows from jangly 80s pop in a good way. Production overall borrows from that big synthetic 80s drum sound. Amber Bain's voice, a lovely indie (re: imperfect) front girl, is produced in a way that could carry ships across seas; full and extending. \n\n\nThe album takes a deliberately quieter and personal midsection. Amber lazily singing lines like \"everybody hates me\" in true millennial fashion is juxtaposed with Giorgio moroder like synth lines. \n\n\nProduction gets decidedly more basic as the album unfolds with the final two tracks really just leaving her singing some slow songs. It's not my favorite but they are genuine and crafted with love. \n\n\n\n\nMore Info \n\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/The-Japanese-House-Good-At-Falling/release/13372422 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen! \n\n\nYoutube \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEzYD4ZielY \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J88UF4HxHhw \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpotify",

His production is top notch with a professional polish and rich sound. Tracks are often built around generic house beat but then he'll add production flourishes with borrowed acid synths and bass lines with a slight leftfield stutter. Songs run a little long and he takes his time opening them up, truthfully it feels at odds with the accessible vibe he's putting on. 'Trails' for instance has a strong celebratory feeling but it lingers too long at 6 minutes and it wants by the end. \n\n\nLyrically its weak. Feels forced like he's reaching for profound but it's lacking; I'd prefer a more personal approach. \n\n\nOverall more bad than good with an impressive amount of consistency.

It's a wanderlust feeling that speaks really well to a coming of age person, exploring relationships with poetry but not sappiness. The twinge of psychedelica gives it this slight haze that serves as a great balance to the expertly crafted pop. It shows it's age in places but I still really enjoy the first half which continues to age well, especially with newer fascinations with 'chill vibes'. \n\n\nFor years this was exclusively a headphone album.

Clicking through to his spotify profile he has an artist playlist called melodic aphex twin tracks; before even hearing a note it seemed like we shared similar tastes. \n\n\nI was right, this album has some great ambient with tracks that maintain the wide open freeform of ambient while still incorporating melody and structure. These melodic moments give this an overall pleasantness. 'Saptiro' towards the middle changes things directly into left field electro territory, adding some hand drum rhythm. 'Unborn' is an album highlight, with a rousing choral sample and deep bass thump. Probably the most intense moment. \n\n\nOverall the album is far too long, dragging toward the end.

With his blistering free-jazz squawk it makes it feel like the whole thing could boil over at any point. \n\n\nI like the overall style, jazzy without too much exploration.

I like it overall but I've also given it more listens because I'm a fan of theirs. \n\n\nThere's interesting things happening, the band has become very good at creating an overall vibe, but the songs themselves feel a bit rough. Maybe that's the point: a lot of this is wonderful live and can be fleshed out further into some really engaging live sets. The incorporation of strings reminds me of a smoother version of Beck's string heavy stuff and super furry animals catalog from the 2000's; it's as if Radiohead returns to that period of alt-rock instead of pressing ahead with their own explorations. Maybe they're just getting old, Yorke is pretty lyrical here and I think got divorced right after this came out (might explain the gloom). \n\n\nSongwriting improves as the album progresses (skip the first three tracks entirely) but this remains a mediocre spot in their catalog. \n\n\n\n\nMore Info \n\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-A-Moon-Shaped-Pool/release/8581632 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen! \n\n\nYoutube \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI2oS2hoL0k \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTAU7lLDZYU \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ti6qhk3tX2s \n\n\n\n\nSpotify",

Taken alone the tracks on Immer aren't anything special - bit of bounce here, bit of ambiance there - stitched together they become this incredible cohesive entity. The subtle shifts are perfectly timed and show a mastery of songwriting even when it's all borrowed sounds. I love the sparse emptiness of minimal, there's something so alienating yet comforting about it. Immer has a sound I can only describe as grey, like the weather in Berlin or the film tone in those Nordic crime dramas. \n\n\nMayer's skill here is largely reliant on his tasteful selection and vision for this mix which is executed perfectly.

This record succeeds with it's songwriting and leaves rewards got repeat listens. It's presented simply but is an intricate production. \n\n\nPhilip Sherburne did a nice write-up for Pitchfork on this: \n\n\nAs before, Midnight Marker’s breezy melodies and lilting grooves make for a nice, chill listen—good morning-coffee music, cooking music, countryside-drive music. But this is nothing like the studied, stoned remove of anything you’ll find filed under “#chill” on any streaming service. His synths have real bite. His drums, recorded with real sticks on real skins, are enviably muscled. Walsh has said that one of his takeaways from both highlife and funk was that the guitar could function primarily as a percussive instrument, and he continues down that path here, backing up more melodically outgoing riffs and runs with plucked pulse and flicker. \n\n\n\n\nMore Info \n\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/Shy-Layers-Midnight-Marker/release/12081230 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen! \n\n\nYoutube \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYuYnAdVZ7Q \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFwx4Ay70CU \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28GZ8Nomy1w \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbCAdmysIT0 \n\n\nSpotify",

On par with Miles and a must for fans of the genre. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Info \n\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/Donald-Byrd-Ethiopian-Knights/release/890204 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen! \n\n\nYoutube \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtKcvoeO2vA \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhiYaTLP8xM \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAycZvJwtIA \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av4j96aEDAA \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvHQGXdvbDc \nSpotify",

Mariah is one of the better entries with easy to appreciate melodic elements and an overall positive energy. \n\n\nHis particular brand of experimental music has a similar sound - part worldly, new wave, post punk, krautrock's rhythmic chug - that weaves together in a rich sound. \n'Hana ga saitara' borrows this energetic string bow pull, sounds like a ship and it's sort of disorienting.

It's emotional music but some of the impact feels limited by the reliance on synthesisers.

The title track draws on a vintage Detroit style, mixing electro beats and hip-hop vocals—hardly a novel idea in 2019. But a sweet, subtly out-of-place ambient breakdown interrupts the flow at the perfect moment, keeping things interesting. \"Batacuda\" and \"Bells\" are experiments at slower tempos, something we've seen a lot of from UK-based producers in recent years, particularly those in the Timedance camp. \"Batacuda\" floats along, emanating a drowsy humidity, while \"Bells\" is moody and thoughtful, coated in a chiming haze. \"Missed Calls,\" a carefully crafted piece of taught, polyrhythmic braindance, is probably the best track on the EP. With this kind of eclecticism, a producer takes the risk of spreading themselves too thinly, but not K-Lone. He brings an intelligence and inventiveness to everything he does, unifying his work and making it essential listening every time. \n\n\nMore Info \n\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/K-Lone-Sine-Language/release/13695712 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen! \n\n\nYoutube \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifxYPDdNtKk \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erI8pZgHwnc \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQHdaRoJFHw \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTdoBtMea2o \n\n\n\n\nSpotify",

Unfortunately there are these eastern experimental interludes that disrupt the flow creating an uneven listen. \n\n\nThe Good \n'Like it is' centers around a particularly effective 'sad' sax solo with a piano and intimate percussion. \n\n\n'six miles next door' is swinging blues jazz. \n\n\n'Othelia' is a swinging blues thing with a blazing sax solo, harmonica. As much a blues track as it is jazz. The swing borrows from a specific type of rock and roll of the era. \n\n\nThe bad \n'Moon cup' is a let down after. Eastern in influence with cringey Cantonese singing that just doesn't work. \n\n\n'Back home' continues the Eastern sound and I'm just not a fan. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Info \n\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/Yusef-Lateef-The-Blue-Yusef-Lateef/release/376373 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen! \n\n\nYoutube \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3z7853uxgw \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVhov-Y6ToI \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSMVJTrUS4M \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXN-P4qPl5U \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPrOVvqIEBA \n\n\nSpotify",

Great harmonies, acapella-group-like, which is technically impressive. Productions feature mostly sexy beats and lyrics that are genuine and heartfelt. It's pop in many flavors: full on Acapella, dramatic seriousness that soars like a Broadway solo, and danceable club ready tracks. She sings with such confidence that's hard to deny. Definitely a natural talent as melody is offered at every turn with a well-thought out vision at play. This is not an amateur effort and clearly a project of someone who has experience as a songwriter (she was previously a member of the group slow club). \n\n\nI'm gonna give this album credit for sticking with me throughout 2019 and improving on relistens.

The unfriendly acoustics of the house this was recorded in give it a DIY quality. Usually I would dislike this as the levels are a little fucked up but here it adds charm.

Of course jazz fans know him, but outside not a brand name. \n\n\nHere we have a decidedly modern jazz record compositionally played with a heavy rhythmic focus by the awesome Herlin Riley which interplays nicely with Jamal's expert piano playing - melodic and with a natural swing, quick if the band pushes him, easy if not. \n\n\nThere's a lot to like here. Worthy of deep listening as well as energetic atmosphere if more removed settings. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Info \n\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/Ahmad-Jamal-Blue-Moon-The-New-York-Session/release/3624058 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen! \n\n\nYoutube \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcUvkO4A5Vo \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qkaEf4C6FI \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS2Lvw8HV84 \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOAepSLbohs \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezYchfPLkno \n\n\nSpotify",

Rap that incorporates the interesting parts of electro \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThoughts \nI admire hybrids where artists take sounds from a genre's fringes and incorporate them into a popular format. Kanye gets a lot of credit for that with Yeezus but I like this better. Production is what makes Big Fish such a worthwhile record with Staples leveraging a variety of electro producers to create a quilt that is intense, booming and always engaging. His rhymes are direct in delivery, creating a steady presence and interesting juxtaposition against the variety. \n\n\nThe result is a great modern Rap record with a youthful but wise energy. It's uneven but one that's bursting with provoking ideas on what makes effective music. I prefer that to the world of over polished pop without soul and have rewarded it with reslistens. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Info \n\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/Vince-Staples-Big-Fish-Theory/release/11271320 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen! \n\n\nYoutube \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l9kzS_B7gg \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLpH78k5A9A \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeUOvrnOCVY \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6iAzyhm0p0 \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa4vBlzMaeQ \n\n\nSpotify",

I like the use of percussion and keys, it's almost just like traces of just random lines that dissolve into nothing. An avant garde tactic but here it's employed well. Flute is really difficult for me to get right but he nails it, stretching notes into texture. \n\n\nSome of it gets too avant and free for my tastes like on Mappo and excursion, creates a stirring presence that in my opinion detracts from the spiritual that's on the title track and ensenada ( the latter being the real standout on the album). \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Info \n\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/Bennie-Maupin-The-Jewel-In-The-Lotus/release/13642739 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen! \n\n\nYoutube \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8U69QwzAhz4 \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aG1LcUuxp5A \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgwLP5jcjjs \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW_t-kgs9pw \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A78fDGSj5w \n\n\nSpotify",

For years I only knew the guy for his earlier instrumental work but I'm happy I checked this later entry out. I took the description in the 'sounds like' description from Wikipedia as it's accurate but bizarre to read, almost clinical in its description. The draw here is the passionate and earthy grittiness found in timeless music of the era. The combination of those sounds produces something distinct and broadly appealing, it's original music that only the American landscape is capable of producing. \n\n\nMore Info \n\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/Link-Wray-Link-Wray/release/6988842 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen! \n\n\nYoutube \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXrV9mBM7Pk \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es-Zws_ggoY \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozwlKJO7iuw \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZmSZGJggE4 \n\n\n\n\nSpotify",
